  #Use markdown to include code as well as text when exporting file
#HTML works fastest, PDF mainly used when publishing in academia, Word is alright too
#set echo to false once in an rmd file to remove the script and only have the report
#use three apostrophes above and below something to consider it r script,or use ctrl+option+i
# will have a {} with r and you can add a label inside like {r "label name"}
# change output to console instead of inline to avoid a bug
#to output the file use knit to html

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
